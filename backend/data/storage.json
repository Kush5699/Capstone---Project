A Python function is like that machine.\n\n**Analogy:**\n\n*   **Function:** Sandwich-making machine\n*   **Input (Arguments):** Ingredients (bread, cheese, ham)\n*   **Output (Return Value):** Sandwich\n\n**Technical Details:**\n\nIn Python, you define a function using the `def` keyword, followed by the function name, parentheses `()`, and a colon `:`.  Inside the parentheses, you can specify inputs (arguments).  The function's code block is indented. You can use the `return` statement to send a value back when the function is done.\n\nHere's a simple example:\n\n```python\ndef add_numbers(x, y):\n  \"\"\"This function adds two numbers.\"\"\"\n  sum = x + y\n  return sum\n\nresult = add_numbers(5, 3)\nprint(result)  # Output: 8\n```\n\nIn this case, `add_numbers` is the function name, `x` and `y` are the arguments, and `return sum` sends the calculated sum back.\n\nSo, if you wanted to make a function to multiply two numbers, how would you do it?\n"

      "description": "Subject: Urgent: Discount Calculation Function Needed for Client Promotion\n\nBody:\n\nHi,\n\nWe're launching a promotional campaign for a major client next week, and we need a reliable way to calculate discounted prices. The client wants to offer different discount tiers based on the purchase amount.\n\nWe need a Python function that can take the original price and a discount percentage as input and return the final price after the discount is applied. This function needs to handle invalid inputs gracefully (e.g., negative prices or discount percentages outside the valid range of 0-100).\n\nThe deadline for this is EOD today so we can test it thoroughly before the campaign launch.\n\nTask:\n\n1.  Create a function called `calculate_discounted_price` that accepts two arguments:\n    *   `original_price` (a positive number representing the original price)\n    *   `discount_percentage` (a number between 0 and 100 representing the discount percentage)\n\n2.  Inside the function:\n    *   Validate the inputs.\n        *   If `original_price` is not a positive number, return an error message: \"Error: Invalid price.\"\n        *   If `discount_percentage` is not a number between 0 and 100, return an error message: \"Error: Invalid discount percentage.\"\n    *   If the inputs are valid, calculate the discount amount and the final price.\n    *   Return the final price, rounded to two decimal places.\n\n3.  Include a docstring for the function explaining what it does, its arguments, and its return value.\n\n4.  Write test cases to ensure the function works correctly with different inputs, including edge cases (e.g., 0% discount, 100% discount).",

These sources use different temperature scales (Celsius and Fahrenheit). To ensure data consistency, we need functions to convert between these scales.\n\nYour task is to create two Python functions: one to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit and another to convert Fahrenheit to Celsius. We need these functions ASAP to proceed with the data integration.\n\nTask:\n\n1.  Create a function called `celsius_to_fahrenheit` that accepts one argument:\n    *   `celsius` (a number representing the temperature in Celsius)\n\n2.  Inside the function:\n    *   Calculate the equivalent temperature in Fahrenheit using the formula: `fahrenheit = (celsius * 9/5) + 32`\n    *   Return the calculated Fahrenheit temperature.\n\n3.  Create a function called `fahrenheit_to_celsius` that accepts one argument:\n    *   `fahrenheit` (a number representing the temperature in Fahrenheit)\n\n4.  Inside the function:\n    *   Calculate the equivalent temperature in Celsius using the formula: `celsius = (fahrenheit - 32) * 5/9`\n    *   Return the calculated Celsius temperature.\n\n5.  Include docstrings for both functions explaining what they do, their arguments, and their return values.\n\n6.  Write test cases to ensure both functions work correctly with various temperatures, including freezing (0\u00b0C, 32\u00b0F) and boiling points (100\u00b0C, 212\u00b0F).

      "title": "Implement a Simple Chatbot using Regular Expressions",
      "description": "Subject: New Task: Simple Regex Chatbot\n\nBody:\n\nAlright, let's put your knowledge into practice. We have a potential client who wants a very basic chatbot for their website's FAQ section. They're on a tight budget, so we can't use any fancy AI. Your task is to create a rudimentary chatbot that responds to specific questions using regular expressions. This will give the client *something* functional quickly, and it'll be good practice for you. Deadline is EOD tomorrow.\n\nTask:\n\n1.  **Define a set of questions and corresponding answers.** These should be related to common website FAQs (e.g., \"What is your return policy?\", \"How do I track my order?\", \"What payment methods do you accept?\"). Aim for at least 5 question-answer pairs. Store these in a suitable data structure (e.g., a dictionary).\n\n2.  **Write regular expressions for each question.** The regex should be flexible enough to handle variations in phrasing (e.g., \"return policy\", \"returns policy\", \"what is your return process?\").  Use the `re` module in Python.  Pay attention to case-insensitive matching.\n\n3.  **Create a `chatbot()` function.** This function should take a user's input (a question) as a string, iterate through your question-answer pairs, and check if the input matches any of your regex patterns. If a match is found, return the corresponding answer. If no match is found, return a default response like \"I'm sorry, I don't understand your question.\"\n\n4.  **Implement a simple command-line interface.** Allow the user to type in questions and see the chatbot's responses.  Include a way for the user to exit the chatbot (e.g., by typing \"quit\").\n\n5.  **Demonstrate the chatbot's functionality.** Show that it can correctly answer the predefined questions, even with slight variations in phrasing. Also, show that it handles unknown questions gracefully.\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef chatbot(input_text):\n    # 1. Define questions and answers\n    qa_pairs = {\n        \"return_policy\": {\n            \"regex\": r\"(return|returns).*(policy|process)\",\n            \"answer\": \"Our return policy allows you to return items within 30 days of purchase.\"\n        },\n        \"track_order\": {\n            \"regex\": r\"track.*order\",\n            \"answer\": \"You can track your order by visiting our website and entering your order number.\"\n        },\n        \"payment_methods\": {\n            \"regex\": r\"(payment|pay).*(method|option)\",\n            \"answer\": \"We accept Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and PayPal.\"\n        }\n    }\n\n    # 2. Iterate through question-answer pairs and check for a match\n    for key, value in qa_pairs.items():\n        if re.search(value[\"regex\"], input_text, re.IGNORECASE):\n            return value[\"answer\"]\n\n    # 3. Default response if no match is found\n    return \"I'm sorry, I don't understand your question.\"\n\n# 4. Command-line interface\nwhile True:\n    user_input = input(\"You: \")\n    if user_input.lower() == \"quit\":\n        break\n    response = chatbot(user_input)\n    print(\"Chatbot:\", response)\n\n```",
